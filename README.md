# Dicee 

## Introduction

Dicee uses the core programming concepts that form the foundation of most of the apps. This app uses stateful Flutter widgets and explores the functionality of setState(). 
It is a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!

## New Concepts Learned
- Using Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- Using Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
- Changing the properties of various widgets.
- Using onPressed listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- Using setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
- Using Expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
- String interpolation
- Data types and functions.
- Used the Dart math library
